# Create a tcp connection to an ip/port couple.
# This script is mainly used to force the loadbalancer into submission.

# Usage: ./ssl_connection_creator.sh <IP> <PORT> <RETRIES> [debug:true/false]

# Why are we doing this?
# =====================
# Netscaler have a "Feature" called "Slow start"
# It doesn't actually help _if_ you have a slow start.
# The problem it tries to solve is burst connection.
# They implemented this in order to avoid calculating
# least connection on a bunch of services that just started.
# They make you use round-robin, until you are out of this 
# starting point in time, then with enough connection.
# you can have your least connection balancing...
# ... a _lot_ of connections.

# Are you kinding me ?
# ===================
# no http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX108886

# What are the parameters of the algorithm ?
# ========================================
# The "Slow start" algorithm is (re)started every:
# - time there is a service in your VIP
# - time there is a new servie added to the pool
#
# The "Slow Start" algorithm has 3 parameters:
# - The RR factor: A hardcoded value in 9.2
# It can be change after 9.3, but not 0 either.
# - The packet engines: Number of CPU cores on the box
# - The services: the number of box in your pool

# How do i calculate the "out of round robin magic number" ?
# ========================================================
# This is simple, one will need to factor all the parameters
# Formula: RR factor * packet engines * services
# Example: 100       * 8              * 10
#

### Parameters ###
##################
# Hardcoded in 9.2, can be redifined after that
# In 9.3 you can change it in the web gui/cli
# In 9.3 you cannot change it to 0
RRFACTOR=100
# Number of CPU cores
PACKETENGINES=8
# Number of instance of the service in the pool
# For us it is the numver of servers
SERVICES=9
